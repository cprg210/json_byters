###### Jaroslaw Czerwinski
- Frontend dev: Working on design, and features of login, register, contact, and custom 404 pages. Major scope of my work was to create professionally looking pages that would have same layout, colors, backgrounds, sizes, to achieve required effect. I implemented some basic HTML form validation for customer input, the more robust validation of customer input is done on back end in our project through Mongoose Passport.  Most of front-end project was done by implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a team we followed convention told in class for creating and separating code into specific groups like CSS files, HTML files, partials, views, public etc. We employed Git and GitHub for our collaboration and merging results of our individual work.
